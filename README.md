Myzriv Projects

This repository showcases my game development work across Unity and Roblox Studio. I focus on world-building, ability systems, UI, VFX, movement, and overall gameplay design. I enjoy experimenting with AI-assisted tools to accelerate development and prototype ideas quickly.

Current Projects
1. Realm of Mystics (Unity Game)

My solo-developed RPG-style game featuring:

World and environment design

NPC dialogue system

Terrain and village building

Player movement and camera setup

Ability system concepts (fire, ice, etc.)

UI/System interface for player stats

2. Roblox Ability Game Prototype

Work-in-progress gameplay:

^Punch VFX tests

^Ability mechanics

^Parkour/Obby map design

^Sword slash experiments

^Aura effects

!Why I'm Building This

I like building interactive systems, learning fast, and turning ideas into working prototypes. Most of these projects are self-taught and continuously improving.
